- Map
 island  docks   caves   volcano castle
 farm    club    flowers jungle  desert
 reactor city    suburbs plains  bay
 militia mall    park    woods   swamp
 lab     beach   estuary rivers  reef

- Plot: It's 7 o'clock on a Friday night and you want to get into a club where
  all your friends are. The club is packed and has a long line to get in though,
  so the only way you'll make it in before the night is over is to get VIP
  admission. Need to know a password for this though.
  - Twist: Along the way you can invite friends to join you at the club. You get
    a different ending depending on how many friends you persuade to come to the
    club. Friend A does not need any convincing to come; however if you want the
    ending where no friends join you then you have to convince them *not* to
    join you.
    - Or make them disappear. They give you a rose as a gift, and when you visit
      the wizard's castle, you can throw it in their fireplace to make friend A
      disappear. The wizard will appear when you do this and ask you what have
      you done.
- Elysium is an afterlife island that all the NPCs reside in. None of the NPCs
  realize that they have died, though their dialogue and locations in the world
  provide hints as to their original demises.
- A beach area where you need a surfboard to cross
- A scene filled almost entirely by a large mall with lots of shops and NPCs
  - One of these shops sells lava-walking boots
  - Maybe add a cut scene where the shop owner demonstrates that it works?
- A mad scientist who gives you a teleportation activation device
  - This unlocks new areas of the game
  - Maybe have a teleporter maze?
  - Has a crush on the wizard?
- A mystic/wizard who gives mind-reading powers to read the mind of the club's
  bodyguard and learn the VIP password
  - The wizard could live in a tower that the player has to climb
    - Maybe could move this off into one of the corners of the map that the
      player can't normally access
- Eight colored doors (one for each ncurses color) with associated keys
  scattered throughout the world
  - Obtain black key through conversation, since it would be be invisible
    otherwise
- Add the ability for the payer to look at visible tiles to see a short
  description of what's there
  - Contains an entity, print it
  - Otherwise, print the type of tile
- Add player vision: <https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/07/what-the-hero-sees/>
